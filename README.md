This is a Python (2 and 3) library that provides a **webcam-based eye tracking system**. It gives you the exact position of the pupils and the gaze direction, in real time.

[![Demo](https://i.imgur.com/WNqgQkO.gif)](https://youtu.be/YEZMk1P0-yw)

In addition, you can map pupil position onto screen coordinates, for example, to determine which window the user is looking at.

User is fixating at the red dots on the screen. The small white dots mark the EPOG estimate.
## Installation

Clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking.git
```

In case you want to version handle this project in your own repo, you will need to use git-lfs to track the large .dat-file 
that is the trained face recognition model used for detecting facial landmarks. 
Install git-lfs: https://gitlab.ida.liu.se/help/workflow/lfs/manage_large_binaries_with_git_lfs.md

Install dependencies (NumPy, OpenCV, Dlib), as well as other dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The Dlib library has four primary prerequisites: Boost, Boost.Python, CMake and X11/XQuartx. If you do not have them, you can [read this article](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/) to know how to easily install them.

In addition, if you want screen-size handling:
```
pip install pypiwin32  # for Windows
```
```
pip install pyobjc  # for MacOS
```
Screen-size handling in MacOS also requires AppKit, which is included in XCode.
```
pip install python3-xlib  # for Linux
```

Run the demo:

```
./epog_example.py
```

## Simple Demo

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3


"""
Demonstration of how to use the eye point of gaze (EPOG) tracking library.

This example application can be called like this (both args are optional):
>> ./epog_example.py 1 'log_file_prefix'

'1': stabilize estimated EPOG w.r.t. previous cluster of EPOGs
'0': allow spurious EPOGs that deviate from cluster (default)

'log_file_prefix': (e.g. user_id) A logfile will be created with the errors, i.e.
the Euclidean distance (in pixels) between test points and corresponding estimated EPOGs.
Log file will be e.g. test_errors/'log_file_prefix'_stab_01-12-2019_18.36.44.txt
If log_file_prefix is omitted, log file will not be created.

Check the README.md for complete documentation.

        # is used within an environment that takes care of event processing.
        # Note: The waitkey function only works if there is at least one HighGUI window created and
        # the window is active. If there are several HighGUI windows, any of them can be active.

## Documentation

In the following examples, `gaze` refers to an instance of the `GazeTracking` class.

### Refresh the frame

```python
gaze.refresh(frame)
```

Pass the frame to analyze (numpy.ndarray). If you want to work with a video stream, you need to put this instruction in a loop, like the example above.

### Position of the left pupil

```python
gaze.pupil_left_coords()
```

Returns the coordinates (x,y) of the left pupil.

### Position of the right pupil

```python
gaze.pupil_right_coords()
```

Returns the coordinates (x,y) of the right pupil.

### Looking to the left

```python
gaze.is_left()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking to the left.

### Looking to the right

```python
gaze.is_right()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking to the right.

### Looking at the center

```python
gaze.is_center()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking at the center.

### Horizontal direction of the gaze

```python
ratio = gaze.horizontal_ratio()
```

Returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the horizontal direction of the gaze. The extreme right is 0.0, the center is 0.5 and the extreme left is 1.0.

### Vertical direction of the gaze

```python
ratio = gaze.vertical_ratio()
```

Returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the vertical direction of the gaze. The extreme top is 0.0, the center is 0.5 and the extreme bottom is 1.0.

### Blinking

```python
gaze.is_blinking()
```

Returns `True` if the user's eyes are closed.

### Webcam frame

```python
frame = gaze.annotated_frame()
```

Returns the main frame with pupils highlighted.

## You want to help?

Your suggestions, bugs reports and pull requests are welcome and appreciated. You can also starring ⭐️ the project!

If the detection of your pupils is not completely optimal, you can send me a video sample of you looking in different directions. I would use it to improve the algorithm.
